# gs-bot

> Version 0.1.0 is the basic structure and starting point for the Discord bot. This is a good starting point for the bot as it contains boilerplate code for starting the bot, handling, reading, and deploying commands, eslint, and a config file that is configured with enviroment variables. You can opt out of using enviroment variables by just adjusting the values in the config file.

## Description

This is a custom Discord bot that uses the Discord.js library. The bot is a for-fun project that is on-going and a way to learn Nodejs, Discordjs, MongoDB, and more. I will be adding new things as time goes on and as my experience grows.
