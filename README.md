## Description

This is a custom Discord bot that uses the Discord.js library. The bot is a for-fun project that is on-going and a way to learn Nodejs, Discordjs, MongoDB, and more. I will be adding new things as time goes on and as my experience grows.

#### Technologies

- discord.js `v14.3.0`
- dotenv `v16.0.2`
- discordjs/rest `v1.1.0`
- eslint `v8.23.0`
- nodemon `v2.0.19`

## Questions

- What is the difference between using `interaction.isCommand()` vs `interaction.isChatInputCommand()`?
- Should controllers be classes?
- Should I group all "helpers" into a folder?
- Is it possible to turn NodeHelper into a class? If I can, is there any point?
